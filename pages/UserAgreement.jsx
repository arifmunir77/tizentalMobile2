          Unless expressly prohibited by local law, this Agreement is governed
          by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to any conflict of
          law principles to the contrary. You hereby irrevocably consent to
          jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Harris County
          with respect to any proceeding regarding this Agreement or the
          Software. The 1980 UN Convention for the International Sale of Goods

          In lieu of a lawsuit or any legal action in regards to any dispute
          arising from this Agreement or any action derived or related to/from
          it, you agree to legally binding arbitration by a neutral third party
          from the Texas chapter of the American Association Arbitration in
          Harris County, Texas.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.description}>
          Arbitration is a type of alternative dispute resolution, which
          provides a way to settle claims without litigation. Unlike litigation,
          arbitration takes place before an impartial third party (normally
          called an arbitrator), and the parties have the ability to present
          evidence and testimony at a hearing before the arbitrator. The
          arbitrator then makes a legally binding decision. Arbitration
          typically has a more relaxed application of rules of evidence and
          procedure, and, tends to occur in a less formal setting. Typically,
          each party pays half of the arbitration fees and costs, which can be
          significant.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.description}>
          Each party shall bear its own attorney fees and legal costs in
          connection with the aforementioned arbitration. You also expressly
          agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) shall supersede and
          override the Texas Arbitration Act (TAA), and that any ruling made
          within the Arbitration may be submitted to any Texas state court of
          competent jurisdiction for enforcement thereof.
